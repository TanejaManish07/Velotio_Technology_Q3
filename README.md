You are a big bank and you are making a list of the most financially reliable customers. This is going to be a sorted list and with most reliable customers in the end. Now there are multiple criteria for determining the overall reliability and all of them must be used according to their priorities. Following are the criteria:
Total Account Balance - The more the better
Age - The less the better
Salary - The more the better
Number of dependents - The less the better
These criteria have the priority as mentioned above, i.e. Total account balance will take priority over age. So for example, P1 with age 25 and 100 account balance will be placed higher than P2 with age 22 and account balance 80 but if both had the same account balance then P2 will be placed higher. The same way, all the 4 criteria will come into picture in sorting all the people accordingly. Now you are given a list of objects with each object representing a person and has the above attributes. Your task is to sort them.
